# ðŸ“Š Ad Campaigns Visualization Project

This project explores and visualizes patterns in advertisement campaign data, focusing on attributes such as cost, rating, type, tag, and predicted click-through rate (CTR). It was developed as part of the MIS 6382 Final Project at The University of Texas at Dallas.

## Project Files
- `Final Project 1.ipynb` â€“ The Jupyter Notebook containing data analysis and visualizations.
- `Group12__MIS 6382.502__Final Project.pptx` â€“ The final pitch deck presentation summarizing the findings.

## Key Objectives
- Analyze the relationships between ad campaign variables (cost, rating, CTR, tag, etc.).
- Visualize campaign performance using various plots.
- Draw conclusions about campaign efficiency and effectiveness.

## Visualizations Used
- **Bar Chart** â€“ Total cost distribution by rating (PG-13, PG-17, R).
- **Pie Chart** â€“ Proportional rating breakdown.
- **Box Plot** â€“ Cost distribution by ad tag (Banner, InApp, Interstitial).
- **Scatter Plot** â€“ CTR vs. Cost relationship.
- **Heat Map** â€“ Combined insights of rating, type, and cost.
- **Histogram** â€“ Frequency distribution of campaign costs.
- **Line Graph** â€“ Predicted CTR over time.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- PowerPoint (for visualization summaries)

## Conclusion
- R-rated ads dominate both in quantity and funding.
- Native ads are generally cheaper than non-native ones.
- High costs don't always equate to higher CTR.
- Visual tools are essential for identifying trends in campaign effectiveness.
